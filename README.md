### **Exploring whether Expert Algorithmic Preference might constitute a Partial - yet Functional Predictor of Analytic Result Variation**

Goals: 

1. Statistical re-analysis and modeling of the original MAODS crowdsourcing soccer data. Then implementing the final modeling approach using six different statistical software packages (viz. R, PYTHON, MATLAB, and SPSS + possibly others such as JULIA, SAS, STATA, ...). Finally, performing a comparison of their respective result outputs. 

2. A more fine-grained re-analysis of the collected survey data looking more carefully at mentioned software characteristics, and the relationship between MAODS analysts’ three software expertise (SwE) related knowledge domains and their respective preferential software choices (SwC).
