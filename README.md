## **Project 1**
### **Exploring whether Expert Algorithmic Preference might constitute a Partial - yet Functional Predictor of Analytic Result Variation**

Goals: 

1. Statistical re-analysis and modeling of the original MAODS crowdsourcing soccer data. Then implementing the final modeling approach using six different statistical software packages (viz. R, PYTHON, MATLAB, and SPSS + possibly others like JULIA, SAS, STATA). Finally, performing a comparison of their respective result outputs. 

2. A more fine-grained re-analysis of the collected survey data looking more carefully at mentioned software characteristics, and the relationship between MAODS analystsâ€™ three SwE-related knowledge domains and their respective SwC.
